Beginning Data Analysis - Data Visualization
Using the soil data provided in today's course module, create a scatterplot, box plot and histogram for the SOM_percent column (which represents the % soil organic matter by weight in the soil sample).  Then create the same three plots for Ca ppm (parts per million soil calcium).  

Construct these plots in a Homework23.Rmd file and push the changes to your GitHub repo. Send me a message in slack when you are finished.
